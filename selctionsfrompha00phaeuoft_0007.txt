PREFACE.

THIS little book is intended for boys during their first
year of Latin reading, and has more particularly in view
their advancement in the elements of Latin Syntax. It
is assumed that those who come to it have already a fair
acquaintance with the Accidence of Kennedyâ€™s Smaller
Latin Primer, a book so universally used in public
schools that no apology is needed for referring the
young student to its sections. For beginners a plain
text with no help makes the setting of a fable for pre-
paration out of school almost futile: the difficulties of
syntax are too much for them. Much may be done by
making it possible for a boy to look up such points for
himself, and this is the aim of inserting references in the
text. What he cannot grasp for himself will be made
clear in class, but if he does not himself wrestle with
what is brought before his notice he will be handicapped
when he comes to do the exerciseS. These deal each
with some one or two points of syntax which the reading
lesson is best calculated to illustrate, and moreover they
use as far as possible the Vocabulary of the F able, so that
in this way both syntax and vocabulary are doubly
driven home. Add to this the brief notes, and the
exercises in parsing, and it will be hard for a boy to
leave a lesson without being thoroughly saturated with
its meaning, diction, and construction. The thousand
words of the Vocabularies will be a fair acquisition for a
first year. Among its other merits the Latin of Phaedrus
is exceptionally adapted to the illustration of syntax.
