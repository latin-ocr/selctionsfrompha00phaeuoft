A SYNOPTICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE
WORLD.

A Concise Handbook for Examination Candidates and for Genemi
Reference. Price ιε.

“ Exactly fills the place it professes to fill—that of ‘ concise
handbook for rapid revisal in preparing for examinations
and for general reference'. The matter is to the point, the
outline maps clear, the type and arrangement excellent.”—
University Cor-respondent.

‘⁴ The new Synoptical Geography is a multum in parvo of
geographica} knowledge. It is a bandy little book, and there
is nothing in any examination paper we know of that might
not be looked up from this work, and read up almost sufficiently
for examination purpose5.”—1.ibrary Review.

“Amongst its special excellencies may be mentioned the
useful information provided upon the various routes from
London to the Continent and the European capitals, and
upon the interchange of commodities between England and
her colonies, between the colonies and other parts of the
world, and between the chief foreign ports of internationaJ
importance. The sketch maps, of which there are between
forty and fifty, are clearly printed and well-selected, and they
will be of real value for teaching purposes.”-—Guardian.

“ Quite a new book for the serious and responsible work of
the student—a book to turn to to revise and test and freshen
up and mend the weak places in his geographica-l accom-
plishments, putting matters in a fresh light, supplementing
more voluminous text-books, and arming him at all points
for confidence and security in his knowledge and grasp of
the study. The candidate for examination‚ and the student
who wants to turn his knowledge to account, will find the
book, with its maps, lists, tables, and summaries, invaluable.”

—School Board Chronicle.
