10 SELEGTIONS FROM PHAEDRUS.

and jest, and suppose the laws of nature to be suspended,
but dignity and reverence for truth prevent the parable
doing either of these things.

As to the use of the sable, it was in India and in
Greece that it first claimed a place in literature. XVhen
the tyrants were ruling in Greece it was used for political
purposes‚ and the frequent connection of the fable with
politics may have ⁴awakened the suspicions of Sejanus
as to the object of the writings of Phaedrus. In India,
where the moral purpose of the fable was first empha-
sized, fables were included in one of the sacred books
of Buddha3 and as it was generally believed that the
souls of men after life were transferred to animals and
from them again to human kind, it was easy for the
idea of animals talking and reasoning like men to gain
currency. About 230 ΑΒ. a collection of some 300
Indian and Greek fables was made in Greek verse by
Valerius Babrius, and about 390 a translation into
Latin verse by Avianus. The middle ages knew the
Aesopic fable chiefly through Phaedrus, but, as we
have said, a Phaedrus in prose. “In the twelfth cen-
tury England . . . became the home of the fable,''
and the best known work was the Latin verse trans-
lation of Walter the Englishman 3 but the Aesop of
modern Europe is mostly due to a later collection
made in 1480 by Heinrich Stainhowel.

The fable will probably never be used again as a
form of literature. Its lessons are too simple to be
of much real use to grown-up people living the com-
plicated life of ‘co-day. But just as it had its use for
the earlier ages of the world's history, it still appeals
strongly to young minds with its roundabout way of
presenting the cruder vices and the simpler virtues.
