4 PREFACE.

However, all who have taught know how difficult it is
to determine the order in which syntactical points should
be presented. The order here adopted—which deter-
mines the order of the Fables—is the result of consulting
the opinions, among others, of Bradley, Cook, and
Ritchie. Important points are not allowed to drop
after a single mention, but are insinuated later to nudge
the memory. Important and radica] constructions like
the Accusative and Infinitive are repeated several times.
Part I. illustrates the simple rules of Case 3 and Part II.
is an introduction to the more obvious uses of the
Subjunctive Mood. The Vocabularies are arranged on

the system by which the meanings of words are given ’

once for all, and any forgetfulness pays the penalty of
the necessity of looking the word up in the general
index, where a reference is made to the Fable in which
it was originally given.

I have to express my indebtedness to the inaugura]
lecture on the Fables of Phaedrus of Prof. Robinson
Ellis, Corpus Professor of Latin at Oxford, and to the
introduction to the Fables of Aesop by Joseph Jacobs
(Macmillan‚ 1894). For kind suggestions my thanks are
due to Rev. R. Lee, Headmaster of Christ's Hospita] 3
Arthur Sidgwick, Esq.‚ Corpus Christi College, Oxford3
F. H. Colson, Esq.‚ Headmaster of Plymouth College3
and to my colleague, the Rev„ E. A. VVoodward, whose
experience in teaching Phaedrus has enabled him to
give much kind and useful advice in matters of detail.

If those who may use this book would kindly send me
notice of errors and omissions‚ or make suggestions, I
should he very grateful.
