DIRECTIONS FOR TRANSLATING.

Ι. Count theflm'te verbs till you come to a full stop. The
number of finite verbs gives the number of clauses in the
sentence.

II. Find out which clause makes the important statement
(principal), and Which clause or clauses only help out this
statement (subordinate), αφ, “The books which I lost when
Ι was abroad are found ³. Obviously the important state-
ment is “the books ase found⁷' (principal). The clauses,
“ which I lost'', and ‘⁵' when I was abroad'', are less important
(subordinate). The principal verb is

(a) Usually in the indicative mood.

(β) Not in an adjectival clause (2'.e., one introduced by qm).

(γ) Not in an adverbial clause (ie, one introduced by such
conjunctions as ut ( =that), si (=if>, cum (=when).

ΠΙ. Looking at each clause separately, make out

(α) The subject (noun, pronoun, adjective, infinitive, a
phrase, a clause, or contained in the verb).

(β) The verb (note voice, mood, tense, etc.)

(γ) Other nominatives or words depending on the subject
(adjective, apposition, adjectival clause, genitive,
participia] phrase).

Now translate usfar as you have yooze. Then

(δ) See if the verb is transitive, and, if it is, look for the
accusative (direct object), and sometimes the dative
(indirect object). The object may be qualified in
the same way as the subject in (γ).

Translate again.

(ε) Take all the words left, which will probably be an
adverbial adjunct to the predicate (adverb, ablative
case, preposition, and case, adverbial clause).

Translate again, introducing the conjunction, and all
words not yet taken.
