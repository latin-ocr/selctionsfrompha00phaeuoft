SOME OPINIONS OF THE PRESS
REGARDING

BLACKIE'S ILLUSTRATED LATIN SERIES

Litera'ture says: “It is really delightful to see and to handle
school-books as nice as Messrs. Blackie’s ‘ILLUSTRATED LATIN
SER1E8’‚ edited by Professor Tyrrell.''

The Schoolmaster says cf‘CAESAR, Boox IV': “It would
be difficult to find a more complete school edition of a classic
than this.’'

The dour-nal of Education says of‘THE CATILINE ORATIONs':
“A very good edition. The introduction (with illustrations) gives
an excellent account of Cicero’s life and times, his works, and the
Catilinarian conspiracy. The notes are clear and to the point, and
the vocabulary comprehensive. Lucky indeed is the school-boy
who finds, within the compass of one small volume, practically all
that is necessary for the study of the text.”

The School Guardian saysof‘ EU‘rRopms, Booxs Ι AND II’:
“For complete usefulness we do not remember having seen any
edition to equal this. The boy learns history, translation, anti-
quities, and prose at the same time, and is likely to acquire an
intelligent interest in his work. The edition gets as much instruction
out of the author as can be got.”

The univer-sity Cor-respondent says of ‘HORACE‚ ODEs,
BOOK 11⁷: “The notes are good, far removed from the patent
digesting-machinery that is so often supplied. The illustrations,
chiefly ⁴from gems and marbles, are a distinct addition to the value
of the book.”

Mr. S. G. Owen in The Speaker· says of‘ LIVY, V AND VI’:
“Unqualified praise must be given for Mr. Laming's editions of
Livy. The introductions on Livy’s life and writings and sources,
and on the credibility of early Roman history, are lucid and thorough3
the notes are scholarly, and show a good acquaintance with modern
authorities. ''

The Academy says of‘VIRG1L’s AENmD ΙΙΙ '2 “ Mr. Sandford
has written a delightful essay on Virgil’s style; interesting notes
on the metre and illustrations, and, as if this was not enough, he
has increased the value of the book by a selection of translations
of some of the unforgettable passages. We heartily commend
this attractive text-book to the notice of teachers.''
