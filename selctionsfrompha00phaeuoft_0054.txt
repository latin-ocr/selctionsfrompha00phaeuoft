ΞΟ SELECTIONS FROM PHAEDRUS.

14. simuizsimzdac, ‘when'.
exieris (= exiveris) fut. perf. ; cf. 11. 9, ereum, and note. Also
VII. 7, advenerit.

The second future is here supplied by the words parata est
rapere=rapiet. Why ean pastum be used here to express a

purpose?
15. tibi, dative of disadvantage3 cf. XIV. 10, hosti.
17. dolosa, supply felis.
cavo, local ablative.
IS. suspenso pede, ‘on tiptoe'.

20. simulans. “Quod non est simulo, dissimuloque quod est”,
i.e. simulo is used of pretending something which is not, dissimulo
is used of hiding something which actually is.

20, 21, 22. Note the three pres. participles (simmam, metuens,
rita72.5·,) each describing one of the three characters of the fable ;
and cf. lines l, 2, 3, the three verbs fecerat, pepererat, posuerat,
each at the end of its line. The result is symmetry, or a pleasing
correspondence in the clauses.

21. ruinam, ‘the fall* (of the tree).
23. Quid multa, supply dicam (a subjunctive used deliberatively).

⁶24. praebuerunt, ue make one syllable, the u being half a
consonant. Is Phaedrus accurate? Would a cat feed on pigs?

25. Quantum mali, for gen. cf. IX. 7, and xv. 15.

25, 26. ‘How much mischief a fellow with a double tongue may
hatch, absurd credulity (z'.e. the absurdly credulous) may prove ’.

Documentum habere=cloceri‚ get instruction, and this has
as its object the clause qnantum mali3 cf. “misit legatum ut
duceret'’ (Caesar) = iussit ut duceret.

FABLE XVII.

1. et, ‘and yet'3 cf. xvm. 12, et mercedem postules.

dare is a verba] noun in ace. case, being subject of esse, but it
keeps its own subject (se) and object (consilium). It is considered
as a neuter substantive, hence stultum.

2. ostendamus subj. expressing an exhortation, ‘ let us show '3
cf. XVI. 23, (licam expressing a doubt.

3. edentem, distinguish from edentem.
5. cesserunt, ‘loitered’.

,-

A. questu3 cf. querela, line 10, and distinguish from quaestu
(from quaero); ef. ΙΙ. 5 and 6.
