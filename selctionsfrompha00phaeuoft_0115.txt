A SUMMARY OF BRITISH HISTORY.
By the Rev. EDGAR SANDERSON, M.A. Price υ.

“The earnest student who has thoughtfully and carefully
read his work from standard histories will welcome this
manual as an aid in summarizing his studies. The lazy
student will be glad to find his pabulum prepared, served up,
and almost digested for him.’'—.Journa1 of Education.

“ This little volume is not a history, but a summary of one,
worthy the consideration of all those who have in view the
facing of an examination in which British history plays a
part, sor it will do much to make preparation for it easy. It
is the best of the kind we have yet come across.''-Civil

Ser-vice Gazette.

“A Summary of Emisit History is compact and well
summarized; the appendices deserve special commendafion,
giving in concise form the chief data of our constitutional
naval, military, commercial, literary‚ social, and educational
progress, in a handy form for reference; and useful to the
teacher as ready-made notes sor lesson preparation. The
list of Technical Terms at the end of the book deserve
special commendation.''—-Educational Review.

“The book is cheap, clear, short, full, and well got-up
generally. . . . If the similar work known familiarly as
‘Ince and Gilbert' deserves a sale of over 600‚000 copies,
Mr. Sanderson's deserves a sale of millions.’'—Educational
Times.

“The present book is a remarkably good condensation.
1t would be difficult to name any book where the student
who wishes to get up British history as a whole, or any par-
ticular period, could find the information better put for
examination purposes.'’—Glasgow Her-ald.

“One of the most excellent cheap manuals of history we
have ever looked into. . . . The most valuable part of the
book is the score of appendices upon definite topics‚ such as
Religious History‚ Different Stages of Kingly Power‚ διο. Α
really valuable handbook.''—-Methodist nac-,orden
