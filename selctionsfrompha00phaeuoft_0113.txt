HIS grammar has been prepared by the late Mr.
Scott and Mr. Jones as a natural complement to
their well-known First and Second Courses.

A special feature is the number ot examples given.
These are, for the most part, taken from the First and
Second Comses, so that the student will have met the
examples before in a connected passage.

Being meant for the earlier stages of the study of Latin,
this book omits the mz'nufiae of grammar, and space and
time are thus saved for a thorough study of the essential
points.

Great care has been given to the arrangement and typo-
graphical display of the matter in order to secure the
utmost clearneSS. Thus, use is made throughout of a
synoptical arrangement of parallel columns which shows
the various declensions and conjugations side by side,
bringing out their differences and resemblances.
