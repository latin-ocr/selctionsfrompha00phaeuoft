DIREOTIONS FOR TRANSLATING. 13

SPEcmOEN.

Athenae quum florerent aequis legibus,
Procax libertas civitatem miscuit,
Frenumque solvit pristinum licentia.

I. The first full stop is at licentia; there are three finite
verbs,florere7zt, miscuit, solvit, therefore there are three clauses
to this sentence.

Π. (i.) The first clause (Athenae—legibus) is introduced by
the governing conjunction quum (when), and is a subordinate
adverbia] clause expressing the time of miscuit.

(ii.) The second clause (Procax—miscuit) is not a sub-
ordinate clause ; it makes a direct statement, and is therefore
a principal clause.

(iii.) The third clause (Frenmnqzce—licentia) is connected
to (ii.) by the co-ordinate conjunctior] que (and), and is there—
fore of like character to it, 2'.e., pm'vzczpal. The principa}
verbs (ῃιίεεῑιίί and solvit) are both in the indicative mood.

ΙΙΙ. Examine the clauses separately.

In (i.)

(α) The subject is the noun Athenae.

(β) The verb is florerent (active voice, subjunctive
mood, imperfect tense, plural number, third
person).

(γ) There are no words depending on A thenac.

Translate thus far : “Athens was prospering''.

(δ) Florereozt is not transitive, and so we expect no
objects. Translation remains the same.

(ε) The words left (not counting the conjunction) are
aequis Zeyz'bus in the ablative case forming an
adverbia] adj unct to the verb florerent, and
expressing the mamzer of the prosperity.

Translating again, With the conjunction quum, we
have, “When Athens was prospering under
just laws ²⁷.
