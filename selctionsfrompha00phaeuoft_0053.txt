Norsss. 49

11. Lacerari coepit. Coepi is usually constructed as follows :—
(1) When infin. is active, coepi is active; cf. line 8, suffere coepit.
(2) When infin. is passive, coepi is passive. Here we should ex-
pect laceram· coeptus esc.

12. dicitur edidisse. Latin is personal, English generally' nn-
person ml (⁶ ic is said that he uttered' ); cf. XXIV. 8 and 9, Dixisse

fertur and vides es perdidisse.

13. 0 me infelicem. Accusative used in exclamations3 cf. Ο
fortunatos agyrz'colas ,Ι

qui, causal, ‘seeing that I', etc.; cf. x. 10.

intelligo should strictly be intelliyam. that would be the
tenses of perleyo?

14. Order is, “quam utilia mihi ea fuerint quae despexerain '’.

15. despexeram, laudaram. XVe should expect despexissent,
laudavissem, because these sentences are subordinate to sentences
themselves already subordinate3 cf. XXVI. 6, petierant.

luctfis, for the genitive cf. IX. 7, quantum decoris.

FABLE XVI.

1.1 in sublimi querci,⁴ = in summa quercu, ‘at the top of an oak'3
see ine 3.

2. media, supply quercu, and cf. imam, line 3.
pepererat, supply an object, (3.9. initos.

3. ad imam (quercum) = ad imam partem quereris. Summus
mons. ‘the top of the mountain'; medio campo, ‘in the middle of
the field'3 media nox, ‘ the middle of the night’. These adjectives
(mostly denoting position) denote a part of the substantives with
which they agree, but the substantive is not put in the gyenitioe.

involucris, to avoid repeating aquila, cf. 111. 6, Zanigyer, and
assim.

8. Take quod (‘whereas') first. Order is, “quod vides aprum
insidiosum sod. terr. quotid'’‚ etc. that English word is inserted

after vides?
9. insidiosum. As aper here=s0w‚ we should expect insidiosam.
10. plano, nent. adj. as substantive.

ll. offuso, perturbatis. Translate as if these were past parti-
ciples active agreeing with felis. ‘And when she (the cat) had
filled her (the eagle)'.

13. Keep the order of the Latin.
