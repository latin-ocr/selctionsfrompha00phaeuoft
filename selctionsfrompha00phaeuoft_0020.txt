PROSODY.

Prosody is the grammar of musically measured sentences
and so deals with metre. The metre of these fables is called
Iambic. The lines are made up of six divisions called feet,
and each foot consists of two syllables. The feet are mainly
of two kinds, iambi, and spouclees.

An iambus consists of a short followed by a long syllable,
e.9., bonis.

A spomlee consists of two long syllables, ομ, pennas.
When we break up a line into its feet we are said to scau it
(scando, I climb). Thus ς

ᾸὺὶιέῑιΙεἛ qsffim 1 florerlent asseqluis leglibfis‚
Procax Ι 1ῑ1)ἓι·ἐἰέιε eivliffltlem misclnit‚
Frenfimlque solviit pristlinsun Ι licentlia.

Latin (like Greek) poetry then cannot be written unless
you know the quantity (z‘.e.‚ the time taken to pronounce) of
each syllable, and conversely reading Latin poetry helps you
to remember whether syllables are long or short. English
verse differs from Latin iu the fact that it takes into account
not so much the length of syllables as the places where the
stress or aecent falls, effi,

How hap l py is Ι the blame! less vestl al's lot.

Here the (locent is on the even syllables, but in the first
foot ‘how' takes quite as long to pronounce as ‘hap', in the
fourth ‘less' takes as long as ‘x-est’, and in the fifth ‘ al’s’ is
as long as ‘lot⁷. But the verse is correct because the even
syllables take the accent, that is, are pronounced more loudly
than the odd ones, and quantity in English is not so important
as aecem.

Nota—The references in brackets at the head of each Fable
are to the numbering of the Fables in White’s Grammar
School Text. The figures in the text refer to the
sections of the Smaller Latin Primer.
